Apply a pea-sized amount of toothpaste to the bristles. Start Brushing\\n\\nHold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums. Use gentle, circular motions to clean the front surfaces of your teeth (not hard scrubbing). Brush All Surfaces\\n\\nFront Surfaces: Clean the outer surfaces of all teeth. Back Surfaces: Flip your toothbrush to clean the inside surfaces of your teeth. Chewing Surfaces: Scrub the top of your molars where food particles collect. Focus on the Gums\\n\\nGently brush along the gumline to remove plaque buildup, but donâ€™t press too hard. Brush Your Tongue\\n\\nRun the bristles or a tongue scraper across your tongue to remove bacteria and freshen your breath. Rinse\\n\\nSpit out the toothpaste and rinse your mouth with water. Rinse your toothbrush thoroughly under running water. (Optional) Floss and Mouthwash\\n\\nUse floss to clean between your teeth. Slide it gently to avoid damaging gums. Swish with mouthwash for 30 seconds to kill bacteria and freshen breath. Tips: Brush for 2 minutes total (30 seconds per quadrant of your mouth). Brush twice a day (morning and night). Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months or sooner if the bristles are frayed.

Hereâ€™s a quick step-by-step guide to brushing your teeth:\\n\\nWhat Youâ€™ll Need: A toothbrush (soft-bristled is recommended) Toothpaste (preferably fluoride-based) Water Floss (optional but recommended) Mouthwash (optional) Steps: Prepare Your Toothbrush\\n\\nWet your toothbrush with a little water. Apply a pea-sized amount of toothpaste to the bristles. Start Brushing\\n\\nHold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums. Use gentle, circular motions to clean the front surfaces of your teeth (not hard scrubbing). Brush All Surfaces\\n\\nFront Surfaces: Clean the outer surfaces of all teeth. Back Surfaces: Flip your toothbrush to clean the inside surfaces of your teeth. Chewing Surfaces: Scrub the top of your molars where food particles collect. Focus on the Gums\\n\\nGently brush along the gumline to remove plaque buildup, but donâ€™t press too hard. Brush Your Tongue\\n\\nRun the bristles or a tongue scraper across your tongue to remove bacteria and freshen your breath. Rinse\\n\\nSpit out the toothpaste and rinse your mouth with water. Rinse your toothbrush thoroughly under running water. (Optional) Floss and Mouthwash\\n\\nUse floss to clean between your teeth. Slide it gently to avoid damaging gums. Swish with mouthwash for 30 seconds to kill bacteria and freshen breath. Tips: Brush for 2 minutes total (30 seconds per quadrant of your mouth). Brush twice a day (morning and night). Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months or sooner if the bristles are frayed.
